LOREKEEPER

This is a side project I am undertaking to help solidify my knowledge of Ruby & Rails.

About Lorekeeper

Lorekeeper was an idea born from my current hobby as a Dungeon Master for a wide variety of Role Playing Games (Dungeons & Dragons, Pathfinder, etc). I was finding it hard to keep track of all the different story points for each campaign, and wanted a place where I could keep all those details recorded and quickly find them later.

Lorekeeper is a database tool for DM's to keep track of multiple campaigns and all the details that fall within (city names, NPCs, creatures, etc). I also plan on making a section to keep Player Character information for DM's.


What Makes Lorekeeper Tick

Back End:  Rails v5
Front End: Angular.js

How to Access Lorekeeper

Feel free to fork my repository onto your local machienes and run it using:

I don't plan on deploying this to the web, just maintained as a local software tool. If this changes, I will update this section with additional details.
